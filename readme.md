# Node Server Setup
This will install the latest version of Node, your choice of Apache or Nginx, create your Vhost, reverse proxying from a domain to a port you specify.

It will also create a non root user, set up a firewall (ports 80, 443 and 22 only) and set up the SSH key access to match the root user.
